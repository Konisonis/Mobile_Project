# Note for usage of styling xml files
at the moment there are three files: style.xml, buttonshape.xml & edittext_rounded.xml. style.xml at the moment contains only color theme. You can use it in the component by referencing in color area: "@color/colorName", for button and edit text component: first you create button & edit text component, then you reference the style by using: android:background="@drawable/buttonshape" (or "@drawable/edittext_rounded", the style will be applied automatically. You just need to care about the alignment  / positioning.
